MAT is a simple memory analysis tool intended to help
understand where the memory is used in a program.

The tool works by using a small shared library that
can be loaded by using the LD_PRELOAD dynamic linker option.
The shared library collects memory allocation events and
generates an event file that can be analyzed by MAT tool.

From the event file, the tool is able to provide useful
information.  This includes the detail about the memory
allocation (size, address), the complete stack frame where the
memory allocation was made, the timestamp and thread information.

To use MAT, you'll need to intrument your application
and then to analyze the results with the tool.

Building mat
============
The package is composed of three separate components:

- libmat is the shared library that instruments the memory allocation.
- matl is a small launcher that helps instrument a program with libmat.
- mat is the analysis tool.

libmat and matl are written in C and mat is written in Ada which requires
the GNAT Ada compiler.  By default the mat component is not built.
If you only need libmat and matl, configure and build as follows:

  ./configure
  make

To build a 32-bit or 64-bit version of the shared library you may use:

  CC="/usr/bin/gcc -m32" ../mat/configure
  make
or
  CC="/usr/bin/gcc -m64" ../mat/configure
  make

If you're using a cross compilation environment, you should
indicate to the configure your target host.  For example to
build for a remote mips system, use:

  ./configure --host="mips-uclibc-linux" --target=mips-uclibc-linux
  make

To build the mat analysis tool, you must have installed the following
components on your system:

- the GNAT Ada compiler (at least 4.7.3 or higher),
- the GNU Ada Bfd library (https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-bfd.git),
- the Ada Utility Library (https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-util.git)

You must configure and build by using:

  ./configure --enable-mat
  make

Instrumenting your application
==============================

You can instrument the memory allocation by using the matl launcher.

  matl -o name my-program

While the program runs and the libmat.so collect events,
it generates a file 'name-<pid>.mat'.

Start mat with the generated file:

  mat name-xxx.mat

Once the memory events are loaded, you can use the interactive
commands to look at the events.  The first commands you may use
are 'info', 'timeline' and 'sizes' as they give a short summary
and analysis of the events.


Embedded systems
================
On embedded systems, you only need to build the libmat.so and matl parts.
For Mips and ARM, for the backtrace to work, you should compile your program
with the -funwind-tables gcc option.  Instrument your program and copy
the generated .mat files on your Linux host.  Make sure your program is
not stripped and available to the mat program to get the symbols
(use the -s path option if necessary).
