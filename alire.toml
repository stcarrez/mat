long-description = """
MAT is a simple memory analysis tool intended to help
understand where the memory is used in a program.

The tool works by using a small shared library that
can be loaded by using the `LD_PRELOAD` dynamic linker option.
The shared library collects memory allocation events and
generates an event file that can be analyzed by MAT tool.

From the event file, the tool is able to provide useful
information.  This includes the details about the memory
allocation (size, address), the complete stack frame where the
memory allocation was made, the timestamp and thread information.

MAT was created to answer these simple questions:

* where is my memory used?
* what is the size of data structures and their impact on the global memory?
* what function or area of my program is using the most memory?
